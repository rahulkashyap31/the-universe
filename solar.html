      <h1>About Our solar system</h1>
      <p>
        The solar system is made up of the sun and everything that orbits around it,
        including planets, moons, asteroids, comets and meteoroids. It extends from the sun, called Sol by the ancient Romans, and goes past the four inner planets, through the Asteroid Belt to the four gas giants and on to the disk-shaped Kuiper Belt and far beyond to the giant, spherical Oort Cloud and the teardrop-shaped heliopause.
        Scientists estimate that the edge of the solar system is about 9 billion miles (15 billion kilometers) from the sun.

      <h1>Formation</h1>
      <p>
        Many scientists think our solar system formed from a giant, rotating cloud of gas and dust known as the solar nebula.
        As the nebula collapsed because of its gravity, it spun faster and flattened into a disk. Most of the material was pulled toward the center to form the sun. Other particles within the disk collided and stuck together to form asteroid-sized objects named as planetesimals,
        some of which combined to become the asteroids, comets, moons and planets. <br>

        The solar wind from the sun was so powerful that it swept away most of the lighter elements,
         such as hydrogen and helium, from the innermost planets, leaving behind mostly small, rocky worlds. The solar wind was much weaker in the outer regions,
        however, resulting in gas giants made up mostly of hydrogen and helium.
